🚀 App Usage and User Behavior Trends Dashboard 📊
Excited to share my latest Power BI project analyzing user behavior and app usage trends! 🎉 This dashboard provides key insights into screen time, battery drain, data usage, and user demographics across various categories such as age groups, gender, and device models.
🔍 Key Highlights:
✅ Young Adults and Mid-Career individuals exhibit the highest app usage time.
✅ Battery drain is highest in iPhone 12, with a notable decline in other devices.
✅ Android users dominate in data usage compared to iOS users.
✅ Female users slightly outnumber males in this dataset (52% vs. 48%).
✅ Visual interactivity enables deeper exploration of user behavior patterns.
This project reflects my passion for simplifying data insights with interactive visualizations. It also demonstrates the power of Power BI in creating dynamic dashboards for decision-making.
